Thesis: Application of Reinforcement Learning for the Control of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems

This is the software project of my diploma thesis at the Institute of Control Theory at TU Dresden, Germany. 

The goal of the thesis is to investigate the state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning for continuous control of nonlinear dynamic systems

As a reference method, I implemented iLQR, a trajectory optimization algorithm referenced in many RL papers, to solve such problems in a model based fashion.
